[Cards Against](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com)
==========

This project is an online version of the popular party game, Cards against humanity. It utilises web-sockets and the AngularJS framework to allow players to use their smart-phones/tablets as their *hand* whilst a central desktop/laptop connects all the players, tallies points and gives instruction.

It is very much a work in progress at the moment but feel free to contribute.

Disclaimer
----------
I am in no way affiliated with the official Cards Against Humanity card game but they are top blokes and distribute the game under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 2.0 license so it's all kosher. If you like the game I strongly suggest heading over to [their website](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com) and buying a deck yourself.

ToDo
---------
- ~~Connect angular to socket.io on an express server.~~
- ~~Build a simple chat service.~~
- ~~Add functionality for multiple rooms.~~
- ~~Randomly generate rooms on load~~
- Each connected device becomes a player with their own scope/hand
- Add in a few test cards using the chat app as a template
- complete this list
